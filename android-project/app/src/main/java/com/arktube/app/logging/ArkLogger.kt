/**
 * App-wide logger. GoF Singleton: exactly one instance (a Kotlin
 * `object`), lazily bound to a Context via [init], reachable from
 * anywhere without threading a reference through every constructor.
 *
 * Two destinations:
 *  - Logcat, always, for every level -- same as `Log.*` would give you
 *    directly, just funneled through one call site.
 *  - [LOG_FILE_NAME], an internal-storage file (Context.filesDir,
 *    i.e. NOT external/shared storage -- no storage permission needed,
 *    and it's wiped on uninstall) that only ever receives warnings and
 *    errors. That's the file meant to be pulled off a device after
 *    something has gone wrong, e.g.:
 *      adb shell run-as com.arktube.app cat files/--log-failed
 *  (run-as works on a debug build without root; a release build needs
 *  `adb shell` as a rooted/emulator user, or Android Studio's Device
 *  File Explorer, to reach app-internal storage.)
 *
 * Every public method is itself defensive: a logging call must never
 * be what crashes the app, so all file I/O here is wrapped in its own
 * try/catch/finally and silently falls back to Logcat-only on failure.
