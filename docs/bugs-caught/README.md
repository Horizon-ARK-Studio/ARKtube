## Rules

1. Every discovered bug gets an entry under **Active Bugs**.
2. Do not remove a bug merely because a fix was written.
3. A bug is removable only when:
   - the fix is implemented,
   - the relevant test passes,
   - the original reproduction no longer fails,
   - and the fix does not introduce a regression.
4. Once all verification succeeds, remove the bug from this file.
5. Do not keep a separate "Fixed Bugs" section here. Git history, commits, PRs, or changelogs should provide the historical record.
6. If a supposedly fixed bug reappears, create a new entry with a new bug ID and reference the previous fix in `Notes`.
7. Keep entries focused on observable failures rather than vague concerns or speculative cleanup.

## Verification Standard

A bug may be removed only after:

```text
Bug reproduced
    ↓
Root cause identified
    ↓
Fix implemented
    ↓
Build/compile succeeds
    ↓
Regression test passes
    ↓
Original reproduction passes
    ↓
Fix confirmed working
    ↓
BUG REMOVED
````
